## Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * production status: 
   * job statistics: 
     * OSG GRACC: 2.1M pilots, 12.5M walltime hours
     * ATLAS dashboard: 2.2M jobs (38k on opportunistic resources)
=======

   * Production Status:
     * USATLAS total production over the past week was quite stable, at the average level of 65-75K running job slots.
     * We got a clarification from Guenter Grein about the change on the ggus side, which caused the synchronization issue. That change has been rolled back now.

     
## FIFE - FabrIc for Frontier Experiments (Tanya) 
  * 21% of all FIFE jobs were running on the OSG during last 2 weeks
  * NOvA 473K wall hours
  * MU2E 282K wall hours
  * GM2  131K wall hours !!!
  * DUNE  82K wall hours
  * DarkSide 61K wall hours
  * CDF 53K wall hours
  * DES 33K wall hours
  * MicroBooNE 11K wall hours
  * LArIAT 3K wall hours
   
## CMS (David)
   * LHC coming back out of a technical stop last week, CMS work continues to be intermittent, dominated by user analysis.
   * 7.90M wall hours, 4.43M CPU hours, 215k jobs
   * Ggus ticket 129300 didn't manage to open at FNAL until later update.  https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/34352  Test ticket opened yesterday propagated just fine.

## Grid Operations Center (Scott)

   * [GOC Services Availability/Reliability](http://tinyurl.com/pre26vw)
   * [Current Status](http://monitor.grid.iu.edu/availability/production.html)
   * [PerfSonar](http://maddash.aglt2.org/maddash-webui/index.cgi?dashboard=OSG\%20Grid\%20Operations\%20Center\%20Test\%20Mesh\%20Config)

   * No release this cycle
      
## Production Support (Ken)   

   * Monthly highlights
      * Overall hours down to 120M from 133M in May. Difference due mostly to LHC (ALICE -1M, ATLAS -1.5 M, CMS -11.5M)
      * 2,000 CPU hours from GlueX at multiple sites
      * OSG VO nearly flat (slight decrease)
   * FNAL and CERN resolved networking issues for protoDUNE jobs on CERN Tier0
   * Working to get new HTCondor CE set up for NOvA use
   * Received inquiry from LSST-DESC about computing resources in Europe (mostly EGI sites.) Waiting to hear from them on what site(s) they're targeting, and then move to act as a broker.
