## Production Support (Ken)
   
   * Successful test jobs for DUNE at Sheffield via the ITB factory. Production as early as next week?
   * DUNE test jobs in the queue at Imperial; waiting for free resources.
   * Significant failures for NOvA in the past few days. Combination of bug in new production release and a possible failure of some CVMFS stratum 1s to pick up an update. Still investigating.
